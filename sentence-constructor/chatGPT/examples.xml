        - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show russian characters, the cells are just blank
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, start showing the vocabulary table
        - BAD: the sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Subject] [Verb][Location], [Object] [Verb-past]

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

        Vocabulary Table:
        | Russian |	Romaji     |	English        |
        |         |	medved'    |	bear           |
        |         |	dver'      |	door           |
        |         |	musor      |	garbage        |
        |         |	ostavlyat' |	to leave       |
        |         |	byt'       |	to be          |
        |         |	ty         |	you (informal) |
        |         |	snaruzhi   |	outside        |
        
        Possible Sentence Structure:

            Start with the subject (bears) and their location (at the door).

            Use a question structure for the second part (did you leave...?).

            Think about the correct tense for "are" and "did you leave."

        Clues:

            The word for "bears" is the plural form of "–º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å."

            "Are at the door" can be translated as "—É –¥–≤–µ—Ä–∏."

            "Did you leave" is a past tense question, so you‚Äôll need to conjugate "–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å" in the past tense for "—Ç—ã."

            "The garbage out" can be translated as "–º—É—Å–æ—Ä —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏."

        Possible Sentence Structure:

        [Subject] [Verb] [Location], [Object] [Verb-past]

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
