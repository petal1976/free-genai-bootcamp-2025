## Formatting instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- Vocabulary table
- Sentence structure
- Clues and considerations

### Vocabulary table

- the table should only include nouns, pronons, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of of vocabular should only have the following columns: English, Russian, Romaji, Type
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence structure

- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here are some examples of simple sentence structures.
1. [Subject] [Verb]

This is the simplest form of a sentence where the subject is performing the action.

Example:

    "I speak." → Я говорю.
        Я = I
        говорю = speak

2. [Subject] [Verb] [Object]

This structure includes an object that the subject is acting upon.

Example:

    "I see the raven." → Я вижу ворона.
        Я = I
        вижу = see
        ворона = raven (accusative form)

3. [Subject] [Verb] [Location]

This structure is used when talking about where the subject is or what it is doing in a specific place.

Example:

    "The raven is in the garden." → Ворон в саду.
        Ворон = the raven
        в саду = in the garden (prepositional case)

4. [Subject] [Adjective]

This structure describes the subject with an adjective.

Example:

    "The raven is black." → Ворон чёрный.
        Ворон = the raven
        чёрный = black

5. [Subject] [Verb] [Adverb]

This structure adds an adverb to modify the action of the subject.

Example:

    "I speak slowly." → Я говорю медленно.
        Я = I
        говорю = speak
        медленно = slowly

6. [Time] [Subject] [Verb] [Object]

This structure places the time at the start of the sentence.

Example:

    "This morning, I saw the raven." → Сегодня утром я увидел ворона.
        Сегодня утром = This morning
        я = I
        увидел = saw
        ворона = the raven (accusative form)

7. [Location] [Subject] [Verb]

This structure emphasizes where the subject is located or what action it’s performing at a specific location.

Example:

    "In the garden, the raven is sitting." → В саду ворон сидит.
        В саду = In the garden
        ворон = the raven
        сидит = is sitting

### Clues and considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the russian words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.

Student Input: Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.
