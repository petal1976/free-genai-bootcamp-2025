        Vocabulary Table:
        | Russian |	Romaji |	English |
        | –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å |	medved' |	bear |
        | –¥–≤–µ—Ä—å |	dver' |	door |
        | –º—É—Å–æ—Ä |	musor |	garbage |
        | –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å |	ostavlyat' |	to leave |
        | –±—ã—Ç—å |	byt' |	to be |
        | —Ç—ã |	ty |	you (informal) |
        | —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏ |	snaruzhi |	outside |
        
        Possible Sentence Structure:

            Start with the subject (bears) and their location (at the door).

            Use a question structure for the second part (did you leave...?).

            Think about the correct tense for "are" and "did you leave."

        Clues:

            The word for "bears" is the plural form of "–º–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥—å."

            "Are at the door" can be translated as "—É –¥–≤–µ—Ä–∏."

            "Did you leave" is a past tense question, so you‚Äôll need to conjugate "–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å" in the past tense for "—Ç—ã."

            "The garbage out" can be translated as "–º—É—Å–æ—Ä —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–∏."

        Now, try to transcribe the sentence into Russian! Let me know if you need more hints or help. üòä
